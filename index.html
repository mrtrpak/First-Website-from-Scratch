    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="picture of me">
    <p>
        To start with I want to tell you about a bit of my background.
        I was born in Bad Kreuznach, Germany in 1988 to an American Mother and 
        a Austrian Father. We moved to the United States together when I was just 
        3 years old and nowadays I call Charlotte, North Carolina home.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing that I truly love doing is playing video games ranging 
        from sports games, RPGs, turn-based, shooters and many inbetween. Also 
        I'm a huge soccer fan and more specifically a Bayern Munich fan 
        <!--how to hover a definition or translation?-->(Mia San Mia)!
    </p>
    <p>
        Why is it that I want to become a web developer, well the 
        salary opportunities don't
