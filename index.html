                    To start with I want to tell you about a bit of my background.
                    I was born in
                    <!--add in google map hover link on text-->Bad Kreuznach, Germany
                    in 1988 to an American Mother and
                    a Austrian Father. We moved to the United States together when I was just
                    3 years old and nowadays I call Charlotte, North Carolina home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing that I truly love doing is playing video games ranging
                    from sports games, RPGs, turn-based, shooters and many inbetween. Also
                    I'm a huge soccer fan and more specifically a Bayern Munich fan,

                </p>
                <p>
                    Why is it that I want to become a web developer, well the
                    salary opportunities certainly help! I am really looking forward to
                    being able to create a full website or app and to be able to call it
                    my own work. I am looking forward to learning an invaluable skillset!
