# My Portfolio Homepage Project

## Description

The goal of this project is to learn and maximise my talents that I have learned to create a fluid and professional personal homepage.

The main aspects that I have put together are creating an index homepage, a contact page where people can put their information into and also a portfolio page where in the future I will be able to showcase my projects by simply clicking on the photos. I have an image folder holding the images I need to be able to render them and also an assets folder in which I have my CSS. 

There are more intricate things that I have added in to help standout from the rest. In the index.html page I created a hover abbreviation over Mia San Mia which is a colloquial saying in Bavaria which is a specific dialect in German. In the contact.html I added placeholder text in the text areas and also added a character max limit for the message box. In the portfolio.html I made the photos linkable to a new tab which will represent the projects that people can check out. I also added it to where when you hover over the images they will pop and add a box shadow which helps make it stand out and gives it a more responsive feel to the page.

Things that I want to add into this in the future is I want to hover a google maps image of the location I was born in. I want to make a more responsive header and possibly do a navbar with it instead.
